            I am a Junior Full Stack Developer based in Turkey, passionate about continuous learning and skill expansion. I have a diverse skill set ranging from front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS) to back-end (Node.js, Express) development. With a unique perspective from living in Turkey, I am driven to contribute to the global tech community, valuing diversity and collaboration. Eager to connect with fellow professionals, I thrive on networking and engaging in discussions. Outside of coding, I love exploring new places, drawing creativity from different cultures. Additionally, I enjoy making clothes for my family, emphasizing craftsmanship and attention to detailâ€”values that I bring to my coding projects. Open to relocation, I am seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative projects aligned with my values. If you're looking for a passionate, adaptable, and collaborative junior full-stack developer, I invite you to connect and build something amazing together.
